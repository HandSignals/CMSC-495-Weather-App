This is the README for the SAAND weather app.


When running code, use the terminal. Input 'npm start' to start the server which will be at http://localhost:3000/. If you want to see a specific locations information you can use this web address http://localhost:3000/api/weather/current?location= where you just have to fill in the location. For this you can either use a zip code, or you can use a city name. For example you can type 'new york' or 'las vegas' just like that and it will show you the information.
